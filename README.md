# Mood - A Minimalist Mood Tracking App

Welcome to the **Mood** repository! This is a simple and interactive web-based mood tracker designed to help users log and visualise their mood ratings over time.

## ðŸ“œ Description
Mood Tracker allows users to rate their mood on a scale of 1 to 10 each day, with visual feedback through a color-coded grid layout. You can track your moods over the course of a year or across multiple years, with additional features for past and future days.

There's a bit of fun to be hard reading my release notesâ€”I've tried to make them as corporate sounding as possible!

This project is under development, with regular updates bringing new features, UI improvements, and enhanced interactivity.

## ðŸ’š Features
- **Interactive Mood Input**: Click on any day in the grid and rate your mood from 1 to 10.
- **Yearly Mood Overview**: View a full 12-month grid to visualize your moods over time.
- **Dynamic Year Selection**: Easily switch between years and view histroical mood data.
- **Color-Coded Mood Visualization**: Different shades represent mood scores for quick insights.
- **Historical Data Support**: Visual indicators distinguish days with or without recorded moods.

## ðŸš€ Upcomming Features
- **UI**: Introduction of a cleaner UI, with more fluid JS menu transitions.
- **File Structure**: More robust seperate JS, CSS, and HTML file structure as we move away from a 1-page design.
- **AI-Integration**: I know, I know, I'm sorry. This will serve as a useful demomnstration of my ability to provide AI integrated insights, with the ability to turn them off!
- **Mobile-friendly site**: Although I would like to introduce a mobile app this is a long way down the road so for now I'll optimise the site for mobile.
- **Customisable ratings**: I enjoy the flexability of rating my mood out of 10â€”although I will be adding the option to reduce this to rating out of 5.

## ðŸ”§ Try it for yourself!
